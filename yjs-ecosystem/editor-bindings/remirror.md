# Remirror

[Remirror](https://remirror.io/) is a ProseMirror based editor that adapts the [`y-prosemirror`](https://github.com/yjs/y-prosemirror/) module to provide collaboration with Yjs. 

You can try out collaboration live on their website by enabling the "YjsExtension" and duplicating the same window.
